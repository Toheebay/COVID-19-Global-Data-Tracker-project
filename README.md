# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis and visualization report that tracks global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from **Our World in Data**. The goal is to analyze case counts, death rates, vaccination efforts, and trends over time across different countries and continents.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across countries and regions
- Visualize trends using line charts, bar plots, and maps
- Communicate findings using narrative insights and data visualizations in a notebook or report

---

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Plotly** – for interactive charts (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for combining code, charts, and commentary
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations

# How to Run / View the Project

1. *download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   Launch the Jupyter Notebook
   Open the notebook file (e.g.owid-covid.ipynb) and run through the cells.
   Make sure the file owid-covid.csv is saved in the correct path as used in the notebook
   (C:r/Users/hp/Documents/owid-covid.csv or your project folder).

  # Insights and Reflections
#COVID-19 waves can be observed across countries with notable peaks and declines.

Vaccination rollouts vary significantly by region, often correlating with infection control.

Some countries saw high case counts with lower fatality rates — likely due to testing, healthcare, or demographic factors.

Data irregularities highlight the importance of cleaning and validating real-world data before analysis.
